              <b> What makes us human? What underlying characteristic differentiates humans from animals or other creatures? Where does the essence of humanity lie?</b>
              <br>
              <br>Humanity can simply be defined as the quality of being human. Humanity is the human race, which includes everyone on Earth. It’s a word for the qualities that make us human, such as ability to love and have compassion, be creative but not robot. Humanity should be our race. Shah Satnam Ji Girls’ School too believes this under the Holy Guidance of His Highness St. Dr. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Ji Insan as we the human beings only have the power to comprehend humanity. We don’t need a lot of money for humanitarian tasks. Giving a glass of water to a thirsty man or helping someone to cross the road is also a humanitarian task. Kindness is the most important tool to spread love among humanity. <br><br> When we perform such tasks we get inner peace and blessings from the person whom we helped. Human values are the virtues that guide us to take into account the human elements , when we interact with other human beings. Every religion teaches us humanity, love and care. And there is no religion above humanity. So, we feel blessed to say that humanity is our religion. Every human being should offer his assistance irrespective of caste, creed or religion. Being human is our first identity. So, we must comprehend humanity in our day to day lives as it is a reason behind our existence.

Believing this Shah Satnam Ji Girls’ School always keeps on doing and promoting the welfare works like arranging Cleanse Campaign, Planting Trees Campaign, Nature Campaign, Save Water Campaign, Save Energy Campaign, Career Guidance to the girls, distributing ration to the needy people, arranging the poor girls marriage and so on.

            <p class="common-text"> Students here hold rallies to create awareness against violence against girl children, homosexuality, drug abuse etc. The students walk in the lanes of the village and make people aware about evils and the after effects. The villagers appreciate the initiative and also take active part in the informative session. Food is one of the most important needs to survive. Millions of people don’t get enough food, and many have surplus that they waste, so encouraging people to donate food items to the needy. 24×7 food service is available for the needy at the institute’s food bank. <br> The students here distribute food articles including wheat flour, rice, sugar, pulses etc. to the poor families on special occasions. The students understand very well that serving the poor means helping them. It is important to help those in need because it is the right thing to do. There are many ways to help the poor. They need shelter, food, clothing and love. So the students donate clothes to the needy who can’t afford to buy clothes by themselves. The students have developed Book-Bank and Toys-Bank so that the destitute children can also be provided with education and toys. </p>
