            <i>Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the
World. (Nelson Mandela)</i>
            <br>
            I highly recommend Mandela’s opinion that education can change the façade of society but I remember here the words of the great philosopher Montaigne who explains about the philosophy of education for the wellbeing of the children.   He utters:
            <br>
            “Since philosophy is the art which teaches us how to live, and since children need to learn it as much as we do at other ages, why do we not instruct them in it? . . . but in truth I know nothing about the philosophy of education except this: that the greatest and the most important difficulty known to human learning seems to lie in that area which treats how to bring up children and how to educate them.”
            <br>
            Educating the children with holistic development needs much more than merely getting the academic degrees. As physical and intellectual training is necessary for the development of body and mind, similarly spiritual training is indispensable for the growth of spirit. I rather believe that religious practices are equally important and necessary for the wholesome growth of the mind and intellect of the students in the modern spiritual barren and morally depraved phase. 
            <br>
            Being an educationist, I endeavor to inculcate moral education amid students that permeates through their cognizance to help them in being morally and humanity strong to settle in the world. I along with my team through various campaigns, encourage the blooming buds of LITTLE ROSES’ garden to rise in the society with a strong character and acquire a unique identity.
        <br>
        Education is not just what is assumed in text books; it is a journey of self-discovery. In this competitive world the child needs to be confident, empathetic, self-reliant and high-spirited. We, therefore, expose the centered approach of a child in the broadest sense by providing concrete platform with exclusive opportunities.      
    <br>    
    I pray to Almighty for His blessings and support at every step. May God help us in keeping the institute at top for years to come!
