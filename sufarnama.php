            Since the Mughal era, the position of woman was dejected. They had to confine in the four walls and same is continued in rural areas even now. But the magnanimous Saint Dr. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Ji Insan shouldered the responsibility to uplift disconsolate womankind by establishing and accelerating the educational institutes.

            The auspicious establishment of first educational institute Shah Satnam Ji Girls’ School, Sirsa in the golden  history of Dera Sacha Sauda in April 1994. It is glittering like full-moon in full-fledged high sky within a short span. Tending towards the stairs of success Hazoor Pita Ji padded out one more mile-stone to make up the submerged calibre of womankind by establishing Shah Satnam Ji Girls’ College in July, 1997.

            To subjugate and to vie with harsh realities of struggling life our Lord Papa inaugurated Shah Satnam Ji Boys’ School, Sirsa in April 1996, and in July, 2000, Shah Satnam Ji Boys’ College was made to cluster round the approaching youth. Shah Satnam Ji Boys’ School, Sri Gurusar Modia, Rajasthan was added in 2011.

            To let in for the rural woman race one more insuperable tachycardia was stricken up in Sri Gursar Modia, Rajasthan (the home-town of Hazoor Pita Ji) in the form of Shah Satnam Ji Girls’ School & College in July, 2004 and 2009 respectively,  Shah Satnam Ji Girls’ School, Budni (M.P.) in 2007 and Shah Satnam Ji Girls’ School, Taranagar, Rajasthan in 2012. Amazingly they clocked up thousand miles to ferret out a ceaseless success.

            One more honorable mention in the field of technology is launched when Dera Sacha Sauda came up with Shah Satnam Ji Institute of technology & Management, Sirsa in 2002. One more bead was added in the garland as Shah Satnam Ji College of Education, Sirsa.

Hazoor Maharaj Ji – the Johnny-on-the-spot took a jump start by holding the hurricane lamp Saint MSG Glorious International School(Girls) in 2009 and Saint MSG Glorious International School(Boys) in 2012 for low-flying birds.

In an effort to  raise the educational standard of the lasting out weaker and underprivileged section , Shah Satnam Ji Noble School , Kotra, Rajasthan was set up in April 2013. A free  School named Shah Satnam Ji Sewadar School is also established in DSS for the poor people who can’t afford to pay school fee of their wards.

The most astonishing fact of these temples of education is that to tighten up the petals free education has been planned up in this self-centered and self-seeking society.
